# show-me-weather

## Description

A weather application that allows a user to retrieve weather information per city. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by vanilla js. 

- To help re-inforce foundational coding knowledge I have built a weather and forecast web application.
- Overall this project helps individuals track weather in the city of their choosing.
- During this project I used two APIs to call weather and location data. Additionally, I spent time in the DOM using vanilla js to create, append and call html elements. Additionally I worked with event listeners and timing. I also worked with bootstrap to style the page. dayjs() was used to retrieve and format dates. Finally, local browser storage was used to store and retrieve information.

## Installation

No additional installation is required to deploy this project.

## Usage
User gets a weather dashboard with form inputs
When they search for a city
Then they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
When they view current weather conditions for that city
They are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
When they view future weather conditions for that city
THen they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
When they click on a city in the search history
Then they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
