# show-me-weather

## Description

A weather application that allows a user to retrieve weather information per city. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by vanilla js. 

- To help re-inforce foundational coding knowledge I have built a weather and forecast web application.
- Overall this project helps individuals track weather in the city of their choosing.
- During this project I used two APIs to call weather and location data. Additionally, I spent time in the DOM using vanilla js to create, append and call html elements. Additionally I worked with event listeners and timing. I also worked with bootstrap to style the page. dayjs() was used to retrieve and format dates. Finally, local browser storage was used to store and retrieve information.
